This repository includes machine-readable UANanoDock/UnitedAtom input/output files to support submission
of Application Note to the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling:
 
UANanoDock: A web-based UnitedAtom multiscale nano-docking tool for predicting protein adsorption onto nanoparticles.
by J.Subbotina, et. al., doi:TBD

The UANanoDock web-tool is an server application based on UAModel program.

The Zenodo archive consist of results obtained online and by re-using obtained files to create scaled-up pipeline
for in-silico design of immunoassays, that incorporate IgG-AgNP interaction for immunoassay design:

-- the ./web folder contains results obtained by using UANanoDock web-tool
-- ./scaleup folder includes files from scaled-up calculations performed by locally installed version of UAModel
    with input files created online by UANanoDock 
-- benchmarking.csv benchmarking info for UANanoDock online performance
-- acs_uananodock_supporting_materials.ipynb Python notebook with scripts used for plotting figures shown in manuscript.
-- ./nb_assets folder contains outputs from  acs_uananodock_supporting_materials.ipynb (manuscript figures)
